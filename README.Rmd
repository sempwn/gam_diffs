The goal of gamdiffs is to provide a set of convenience functions for the estimation
and associated standard errors / confidence intervals for a range of Generalized
Additive Models. The particular motivation is to provide tools for estimating the 
difference in outcome under certain counterfactual scenarios for models relevant
to population public health.

## Installation

You can install the released version of gamdiffs from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("gamdiffs")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sempwn/gamdiffs")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gamdiffs)
library(mgcv)
## basic usage
res <- gamdiffs:::create_random_data()
m <- mgcv::gam(y ~ s(x), data = res, family = poisson)
baseline_data <- dplyr::tibble(x = 0:20)
counter_data <- dplyr::tibble(x = 21:40)
test_diffs <- calc_sum_counterfactual_gam(m, baseline_data,
  counter_data = counter_data,
  ci = 0.95, delta = TRUE
)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
print(test_diffs)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
